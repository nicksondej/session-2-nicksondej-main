# Course Notes - Session 1
Today we're going to learn about the `numpy` and `pandas` packages and begin learning more powerful ways to manipulate tabular data. We'll apply all of this to our weather dataset.

## After you download and open this repo in VSCode:

### Create a local virtual environment
  ```python3.11 -m venv venv```
  *(when VSCode asks to use the environment, "say Yes")*
   
### Activate the virtual environment
  **On MacOS, Linux, or ChromeOS**
  ```source venv/bin/activate```
   
  **On Windows**
  ```source venv/Scripts/activate```
   
### Install dependencies
  ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
